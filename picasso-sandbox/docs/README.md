# Generate HTML docs

This tool will generate basic HTML docs from the Markdown files in `docs/dist`. `README.md` of the project root will be used as `index.htm√∂`.

## Usage

- Install with `npm install` or `yarn`.
- Make sure docs are built.
- Run `node lib/index.js` or `npm run generate` to build the HTML files into `./dist`.
